* write docs!  also, remember to remove ``ext_package=".."`` from
  setup.py, which was needed with verify() but is just confusion

* mention todo: cffi-runtime package

* mention todo: ffi.new("xyz") makes {"xyz": <ctype>} always immortal

* mention todo: dlopen(), by "compiling" a cdef()-only FFI into a .py module
